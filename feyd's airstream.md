World-Building Brief: Port Provenance

    Fayd's Airstream

Type & Location: Fayd's residence is a 20-foot Airstream-style travel trailer. It is not a separate apartment but a rented space attached to the main house of his landlord, Mike Dewald. The trailer is silver with its classic, unpainted metal exterior. It is tethered to the house for its power and water supply, making it a grounded, stationary object rather than a mobile one.

Dimensions: The trailer is approximately 20 feet long from bumper to tongue and about 7 feet wide on the inside. This makes it a small, intimate space where everything is immediately at hand.

Condition & Furnishings: The Airstream is kept clean and in good repair. It's a bit battered around the edges from a life on the road, but it remains fully functional. It is sparsely but adequately furnished with two lamps (one at the front, one at the back), a small kitchenette, and a tiny bathroom containing a shower stall. All personal effects of the previous occupant have been removed.

The Landlord: The landlord is Mike Dewald. The trailer belonged to Mike's son, Peter, who died in a tragic storm while working on the fishing boats. Mike, hollowed out by this grief, cleared out the trailer before renting it. He is completely unflappable and possesses a deep-seated apathy towards trouble; he "could care less if Fayd was red all over and had horns and a tail," as he has already witnessed the one tragedy that truly matters. This creates a quiet, non-judgmental living arrangement. A future, quiet camaraderie is envisioned between the two men, sharing a beer on lawn chairs.

Symbolism: The Airstream serves as a powerful metaphor for Fayd himself. It is a self-contained, metal capsule designed for movement and freedom, yet it is currently tethered and stationary. It is a place of stillness and isolation for a man who is always running from his own internal "Animal."

Fayd's Personal Effects: Inside this sterile, borrowed space, Fayd has only two items of his own, which represent the two halves of his nature:
A Journal: This is his private cage for the "Animal." It's where he pours out his rage, violence, and raw, unfiltered thoughts without hurting anyone. A Book of Poetry: This is his connection to the man within the monster. It's the language he uses to find beauty and meaning in the world, and to understand his own nature.
