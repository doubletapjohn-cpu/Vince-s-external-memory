World-Building Brief: Mike's Airstream

Name: Mike's Airstream (referred to by Fayd as simply "the Airstream" or "my new little home")

Location & Purpose: Located in the backyard of Mike's house, on the edge of town. It serves as Fayd's first real foothold in Port Provenance, a temporary but private sanctuary. It symbolizes his transient isolation and his attempt to put down roots, however shallow.

Exterior: A classic, silver-skinned Airstream trailer. It is in good condition, with its metallic shine dulled slightly by age and weather. It is connected to the main house via visible electrical and water lines, a physical umbilical cord to the larger world of Mike's grief.

Interior & Atmosphere:

    Layout: A compact, efficient space typical of a travel trailer. The main area functions as a small living space. One end contains a small kitchenette with a mini-fridge and microwave. The opposite end is a small bedroom with a bed. A tiny bathroom is accessible via a door in the bedroom.
    Decor: The interior is spartan and plain. The walls are the standard, muted vinyl of an Airstream. The lighting is provided by a couple of simple lamps. There is a folding desk and chair. The space is clean but sterile, reflecting its recent preparation for a new tenant.
    Key Features: The bed is made up with new, clean white sheets and a new pale green comforter, a stark contrast to the grief that hangs over the main house. Faint tape marks on the aluminum walls suggest that personal decorations or posters belonging to Mike's son were recently removed. An open air vent is situated directly over the bed.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere is one of quiet, borrowed solitude. It is a peaceful space, but one tinged with the unspoken sorrow of the main house. It is a liminal space for Fayd—not quite a home, but more than a hotel room. It is a place for him to retreat, think, and be alone with his thoughts about Kim and the Animal.

Role in the Story: The Airstream cements Fayd's decision to stay in Port Provenance, moving him from a transient visitor to a temporary resident. It provides him with a private space to process the events of the day and his powerful, confusing connection to Kim. Its sterile, temporary nature underscores his own feeling of not belonging, while its connection to a story of loss (Mike's son) subtly mirrors his own internal wounds.
