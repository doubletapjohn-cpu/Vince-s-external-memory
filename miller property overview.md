The Miller Property: A Complete Description

Overview: The Miller property is a secluded, 80-acre parcel of land in a rural, forested region. It is a world unto itself, defined by its profound isolation and the stark contrast between its maintained, civilized core and the untamed wilderness that surrounds it.

Access & Isolation: The property is accessed exclusively by a private dirt road that splits off from a quiet state highway approximately a mile away. This road is the sole point of entry and it dead-ends at the property line, ensuring there is no passing traffic and no casual visitors. This creates a sense of being a small, self-contained kingdom, completely cut off from the outside world.

The Front: The Approach The dirt road curves up through a wide, open field of tall, unmowed grass that turns brilliant gold in the late summer. Scattered throughout this field are a few wild, gnarled apple trees, their fruit left for the deer. The driveway is bordered on one side by a low, crumbling stone wall—a project started by a great-grandfather and never finished, a relic of ambition and time.

The Core: The Main House & Barn The driveway terminates in a wide loop in front of the main house. This is the functional heart of the property. The house itself is a classic two-story farmhouse, solid and permanent, facing the road. The area around the driveway is packed dirt and gravel, the zone of daily comings and goings. Off to one side, set a little ways from the main house, sits the large, faded red barn. It is the center of labor on the property, a place of work, storage, and practical solitude.

The Rear: The Private World & The View Behind the main house, the landscape transforms. The open field gives way to a dense forest of towering Douglas firs and cedars. The ground here is soft, covered in a carpet of pine needles and moss. Critically, the woods do not form an impenetrable wall. Instead, a wide, natural corridor—a small, open valley or "draw"—slopes gently down from the rear of Leo's house. It is through this corridor that the property's most significant relationship is defined.

The Second Dwelling: Kim's Cottage Kim's cottage is situated in a small clearing at the other end of this natural corridor, approximately 150 yards from the back of the main house. This distance is crucial: it is close enough to be a constant, visible presence, but far enough away to feel like a separate, distinct world. The cottage is a small, single-story rectangle, humble and worn, with a thick carpet of moss on its roof. It looks less like a house and more like a part of the forest that has agreed to be a shelter. This line of sight is the property's defining feature.

The Boundary: The property's edges are not sharply defined. To the east, it is bordered by a small, rocky creek. To the west and north, it blends seamlessly into vast, state-owned forest land that stretches for miles. There are no fences on these borders, only the natural transition from maintained land to untamed woods. It is a place that feels both owned and wild, a small patch of civilization that Leo maintains, surrounded by the immense, indifferent world he loves.
