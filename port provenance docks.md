Location Sheet: The Docks

Overall Atmosphere:

    Functional and Worn: The docks are not a tourist attraction. They are a working space, built for utility, not beauty. Everything smells of brine, diesel, and creosote. The wood is weathered, silver-gray, and slick with sea spray. The sounds are constant: the groan of mooring lines, the cry of gulls, the rumble of diesel engines, and the clang of gear.
    A Maze of Piers and Walkways: It's not a single straight dock. It's a series of long, interconnected piers jutting out into the bay, with narrower floating walkways between them. It's easy to get turned around, and there are countless small, hidden spaces—under piers, behind stacks of crab pots, in the shadows of the cannery.
    Tied to the Rhythm of the Tides: The entire area's mood changes with the tide. At high tide, it's bustling with activity as boats come and go. At low tide, the water recedes, leaving seaweed-slimed pilings exposed and a smell of mud and decay in the air. The mood is quieter, more introspective.

Key Areas:

    The Main Pier (Pier 1): The largest and busiest pier. This is where the bigger fishing trawlers and any supply boats moor. It's the most public-facing part of the docks.
    The "Graveyard" Pier (Pier 3): The farthest and most dilapidated pier. It's where old, derelict boats are left to rot. It's structurally unsound in places and generally avoided by most of the town. It's a perfect place for a private conversation or to hide something.
    The Boatyard: A fenced-off area of dry land at the edge of the docks, filled with engine blocks, piles of rope, and the skeletal frames of boats under repair. This is Silas's domain. It's cluttered, greasy, and smells of gasoline and sawdust.
    The Cannery: A long, low-slung, rust-stained building at the far end of the docks. It's been mostly dormant for years, its windows boarded up. It's a landmark and a reminder of the town's more prosperous past. It looms over the docks like a silent giant.

Sensory Details:

    Smell: Salt, low tide, diesel fuel, fish guts, hot metal from engines, wet wood.
    Sound: Lapping water, creaking ropes, seagulls, diesel engines coughing to life, the clang of tools, the distant shout of a fisherman.
    Sight: Gulls circling overhead, the glint of sun on water, peeling paint, rust, tangled nets, stacks of crab pots, the constant, gentle sway of everything.
    Touch: The slick, damp feel of railings, the rough texture of rope, the splintery wood of the walkways, the biting wind coming off the water.

Inhabitants:

    The Fishermen: Hardworking, pragmatic, and weathered men. They are the lifeblood of the town. They keep to themselves but are fiercely protective of their community. They are the primary audience for Feyd's "test."
    Silas: The old mechanic. He's the keeper of the boatyard, the man everyone goes to when their engine fails. He's a fixture, as much a part of the docks as the pilings.
    The Transients: A few seasonal workers or sailors passing through. They are temporary, faceless figures who don't stay long and don't ask questions.
