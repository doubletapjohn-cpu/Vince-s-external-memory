Vehicle Profile: Kim's Car

    Model: 1998-2003 Buick Regal, four-door sedan.
    Exterior: Faded tan or light brown, with dull, sun-bleached paint on the roof and hood. It's an unassuming, practical car that blends in.
    Interior: Worn but intact. The seats show signs of use, and the plastic components are faded but functional. It feels like a well-used, reliable space.
    Character & Narrative Role: This car is a symbol of Kim's old life: sensible, reliable, and unpretentious. Its breakdown on the side of the road is the event that shatters her predictable world and forces her into the path of Fayd.
    The Breakdown & Repair: The car stalled due to a failed Crankshaft Position Sensor. Fayd, familiar with this type of GM engine, performed a simple, on-the-spot fix by locating and temporarily securing a chafed wire in the main harness. This act of quiet competence was enough to get the car running again, demonstrating his practical skills.
