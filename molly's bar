World-Building Brief: Molly's Bar

Name: Molly's

Location & Purpose: The town's true bar—the place for drinking and socializing after dark. It is intentionally located on the edge of town, creating a psychological boundary. It's the place you go when the community comfort of the main drag is not enough, a liminal space between the order of the town and the wildness of the surrounding woods. It serves as the town's subconscious, a place of quiet escape and raw authenticity.

The Legend: The bar is named after a woman named Molly, who has become a local legend. The common story is that her husband gave her the bar long ago to ensure she would never be dependent on anyone. She is a symbol of strength and independence. A grainy, black-and-white photo of a woman hangs over the bar, presumed to be Molly, but no one knows for sure. The ambiguity is part of the town's mythology.

Interior & Atmosphere:

    Layout: The interior is oblong with a plain, dark wood floor where the stain is wearing away in high-traffic areas.
    The Bar: The centerpiece is a massive, solid bar made from a single tree that was cut in half, its grain beautifully varnished. The curve of the underside is a functional flaw; patrons occasionally bang their knees on it. The bar is bracketed at each end by thick, sturdy square wooden posts.
    Lighting: The lighting is dim and atmospheric, coming primarily from neon signs for beers (Budweiser, Miller Lite) and liquors (Jägermeister). This is supplemented by a few wall lamps with old-fashioned incandescent bulbs. The ceiling is made of the standard white, acoustic tiles, some with pieces missing.
    Decor: The walls are a living history, covered in old flyers and photographs of the town dating back to the early 1920s. There are also pictures of customers who have passed away, some nearly as old as the bar itself.
    Features: At one end of the bar is a brand-new jukebox, its neon lighting looking somewhat out of place against the otherwise vintage interior. In the center of the room are a few tables. Near the jukebox is a well-used but not new pool table. On weekends, a local "band"—which is really just three guys who can actually play—sets up on a raised platform made from an old, overturned wooden box covered in that classic fake-grass carpet.

Staff: The bar is run by Pam, an older, heavy-set woman who doesn't take grief from anyone. She has dry, hysterical humor and wears her hair in a bun perched on the back of her head. She is the gatekeeper and steward of Molly's legacy. A younger woman, Margarete, sometimes fills in. The townsfolk have collectively decided to call her "Molly," anointing her as the successor to the bar's spirit, even though everyone knows her real name.
