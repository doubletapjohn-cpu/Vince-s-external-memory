The Aetherium: An Overview

The Singular Force:

In the beginning, there was the Aetherium, a primal force of creation that was as much a part of the natural world as the tides or the seasons. It was not a conscious entity but an intelligence that resonated with the natural world, driving the ebb and flow of life with a purposeful, yet subtle, hand.

The Aetherium was a creative force, capable of manifesting its will into reality. It could sense the need for something and bring it into being, though the methods of its creation were as ancient and mysterious as the stars themselves. However, the Aetherium's creations were not one-sided. For every act of beauty and wonder, there was a counterpart, a shadow that emerged from the same well of potential. Love was mirrored by hate, joy by sorrow. This duality was not a flaw but a fundamental aspect of the Aetherium's nature, a necessary counterpoint that maintained the cosmic equilibrium.

As the Aetherium continued to create, the void it had pushed the discordant energies into began to swell. The negative forces, unchecked and unformed, started to seep back into the fabric of reality, threatening to corrupt the very balance the Aetherium had established. This was the first sign that the Aetherium's perfect stasis was under threat, and it would soon lead to a decision that would change the course of all existence.

The Shattering of the Void:

For eons, the Aetherium maintained a delicate balance, its creative force weaving the tapestry of life and the natural world. Yet, within its own essence, a growing turmoil stirred. The void, once a place of containment for the discordant energies, began to swell with a chaotic power that threatened to overwhelm the Aetherium's harmony.

These negative energies, unchecked and unformed, seeped into the Aetherium's being, corrupting its perfect equilibrium. They were not external threats but internal strife, a cancer eating away at the very core of its existence. The Aetherium, in its ancient wisdom, recognized that it could not destroy the void, for to do so would be to destroy a part of itself. Nor could it continue to contain the chaos, for it threatened to consume all that was.

But the true danger lay in the nature of these negative energies. They were drawn to the Aetherium, seeking to become one with it again, to return to that from which they sprang. This fusion would have destroyed the Aetherium utterly, consuming its essence and leaving only chaos in its wake.

In a moment of cosmic introspection, the Aetherium made a choice. It would sever itself, dividing into two distinct forces, each with its own purpose and power. This act of division was not one of defeat but of preservation, a strategic retreat to ensure the survival of its essence and the continuation of its creative will.

The Aetherium tore itself asunder, creating two halves that were both identical and opposite. Each half carried within it the memory of the whole, a fragment of the original force, but each was now defined by its new role in the universe. The first half, which we now call the "Creative," was imbued with the gentle, creative spirit of the Aetherium. It was the part that could feel the world, that was attuned to its every nuance and emotion. This half was defenseless and without armor, a pure expression of the Aetherium's creative spirit.

The second half, which we call the "Guardian," was endowed with the power to protect, to defend, and to contain. It was the part of the Aetherium that held the void at bay, that stood as a bulwark against the chaos that threatened to engulf all. This half was fierce, unyielding, and driven by an instinct to shield the Creative half from harm.

With the severing complete, the two halves began their new existence. But the sundering was so powerful that it had an unexpected result: instead of remaining near each other, the two halves were tossed apart, becoming the Dyad. The defenseless Creative half, now utterly vulnerable, had no choice but to hide. It rode in human hosts, always careful to avoid the Shards that sought to reunite with it. In the dawn of humanity, it might have been a shy young woman in a prehistoric society, regarded as a shamanistic figure due to her ability to 'feel' the emotions of others. As the ages of humans passed, it shifted from one host to another, inhabiting each baby until their death, an endless cycle of rebirth and hiding.

The Guardian, meanwhile, took up the mantle of containment and protection. It rode in humans, but with a different purpose. It was a wanderer, always the warrior, the source of a thousand myths and legends of heroes and villains. Driven by an unyielding instinct to reunite and restore the Aetherium to its former wholeness, it sought the Creative half, always watchful and always ready to defend.

But the sundering had another consequence: it shattered the void, creating the Shards. Each Shard was a facet of the negative energies that had once threatened the Aetherium—hate, envy, rage, and despair, among others. These Shards, too, inhabited humans, but they were not conscious entities. They were more like forces of nature, drawn to hosts that already embodied their essence. A Shard of hate would seek a hateful person, not to increase their hate, but to find a comfortable home. They were relentless in their pursuit of the Creative half, seeking to reunite with it and consume its essence, just as they had once sought to consume the Aetherium.

The Functions That Were Created in That Severing of the Separate Halves:

With the Aetherium torn asunder, the Creative and Guardian halves found themselves imbued with distinct functions, each essential to their new roles in the world. These functions were not merely abilities but fundamental aspects of their beings, shaped by the necessity of their separation and the dangers they now faced.

The Creative half, now defenseless and without armor, was endowed with the ability to empathize and sense the emotions and needs of those around it. This function allowed it to feel the world in a profound and intimate way, understanding the joys and sorrows of its human hosts and the people they encountered. However, this gift was also a curse, as the Creative half lacked the ability to 'tune out' these emotions. The host of the Creative half was often overwhelmed by the emotional turmoil of others, a constant barrage of feelings that could be both exhilarating and exhausting. To the outside world, the Creative half appeared as just another shy, introverted young woman, her true nature concealed beneath a veil of normality. The Creative half had zero effect on the people around it; it could only feel and absorb their emotions, a passive receptor of the world's emotional landscape. It was a silent presence, a hidden observer of the world's emotional tapestry, with its creative manifestations dormant, waiting for the day when the Dyad would be reunited, and the Creative half could once again wield its full power.

The Guardian half, on the other hand, was imbued with the power to protect and contain. It was a relentless force, driven by an instinct to shield the Creative half from harm. This function manifested as an enhanced physical prowess, an unyielding resolve, and a keen intuition that allowed it to sense danger before it struck. The Guardian could channel this power into its human hosts, turning them into formidable warriors and defenders. However, the Guardian was not granted the ability to actively seek its other half. Instead, it was driven by an inner compulsion, a gnawing sense that something in its life was missing. This feeling was a constant presence, a restless energy that pushed the Guardian to wander, always searching, always seeking, but never quite knowing what it was looking for. The Guardian's journey was one of faith and instinct, a endless quest to find what it had lost, guided by a deep-seated knowledge that its purpose lay elsewhere.

The Shards, too, were imbued with functions, but theirs were more primal and passive. Each Shard embodied a negative emotion or trait, such as hate, envy, or rage. These functions allowed the Shards to inhabit, but they had no influence on their human hosts. The Shards were completely passive, content to exist within their hosts, waiting for the opportunity to reunite with the Creative half. The presence of a Shard in a human might manifest as an intensification of the host's existing negative traits, but it would not alter their fundamental nature or grant them new capabilities. The Shards were drawn to the Creative half, seeking to reunite with it and consume its essence, just as they had once sought to consume the Aetherium, but they did so without any active pursuit or manipulation.
