The Ahuric Dyad (Kim Mercer & Feyd Kael)

The Dyad is a cosmic bond of two halves, now fully activated. Their personal afflictions have been transformed from sources of pain into functional, tactical abilities.

    The Creator Half (Kim Mercer): Her "Gauntlet" was a painful, overwhelming psychic ability that forced her to feel the emotions of everyone around her. Post-activation, it is now a tuned receiver. The chaotic noise is gone, replaced by a quiet she can control. She can now "dial in" to specific sources when they are close enough.
    The Guardian Half (Feyd Kael): His "Animal" was a source of chaotic, reactive rage that made him a danger to himself and others. Post-activation, it is now a focused protector. Its aggression is no longer random; it is singularly and unwaveringly aimed at protecting Kim.
    The Activation: The Dyad was activated when Kim touched The Great Hart while Feyd, acting on a purely protective instinct, touched her. This physical contact closed the circuit and triggered the global event.
    The Goal: Their primary goal is immediate: survival. They must learn to use their new abilities and understand the new world they've inadvertently created.

The Avatars (The Global Threat)

The Avatars are the primary antagonists, a scattered, intelligent, and ruthless enemy.

    Origin: They are humans who have fused with a "Shard," a parasitic entity from a metaphysical Void containing only negative aspects (e.g., Greed, Rage, Ambition, Cruelty).
    The "Gift/Curse": A Shard's power is not a new ability, but a supernatural amplification of the host's innate talents (e.g., a CEO becomes a genius capitalist, an artist's work becomes supernaturally compelling). This amplification comes with the complete removal of all moral and ethical constraints, making them ruthlessly effective and amoral.
    Awakening: The Great Hart's signal was a global psychic shockwave. It supercharged already-prepped hosts, turning a long-term, subtle influence ("the whisper") into a full-blown, purpose-driven entity ("the roar").
    The Monochrome Battlefield: There are no "good" Shards. Every single Avatar is hostile. Kim and Feyd have no hope of finding an awakened ally. It is a war of absolute opposition.
    The Strategic Culling: Avatars intelligently recruit other Avatars, seeking synergistic allies (e.g., Greed seeks Ambition) and actively avoiding or destroying potential threats to their nature. They are methodically building an army of darkness.

The Global Event & The New World

The world is descending into a slow-motion, veiled apocalypse.

    The "System Check": The appearance of The Great Hart was a cosmic event, a "system check" to verify that the Dyad was whole again. The massive signal it generated was a side effect of this check, not its primary purpose.
    The Scattered Apocalypse: The Hart's signal was the trigger that awakened the Avatars. A handful of these newly-awakened beings have blinked into existence all over the globe simultaneously, all now hunting the Dyad.
    The Veiled World: The Avatars' actions cause chaos that is rationalized by the public as disconnected, bizarre news stories (e.g., brilliant market moves, viral art phenomena, social unrest). Only Kim and Feyd sense the connection.
    The Hunt: All Avatars share an instinctual purpose: find the beacon (the Dyad) and extinguish it. They are scattered across the globe, all hunting Kim and Feyd independently.

The Dyad's Abilities (Post-Activation)

Their new abilities are functional, not overwhelming, allowing them to learn and grow as a tactical pair.

    Kim's Sense (The Tuned Receiver): Her ability is now a tool she can control. To identify an Avatar, she must be within a few hundred feet of it. She can then consciously "tune in" to its frequency. When she does, she doesn't get thoughts or images; she gets a clear "flavor" of its core, amplified trait (e.g., a cold feeling of Greed, a hot wave of Rage). This is a manageable, tactical identification.
    Feyd's Sense (The Focused Protector): His new sense is a purely proximity-based early warning system called "the pressure." It activates when an Avatar comes within one mile. The pressure intensifies as the Avatar gets closer, moving from a general unease to a crushing, directional force that alerts him to the immediate presence and location of a threat. It is a functional alarm, not a crippling affliction.
