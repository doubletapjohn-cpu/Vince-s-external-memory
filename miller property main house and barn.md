Miller Main House & Barn: A Complete Description

The Main House: Exterior & Approach The Miller house is a classic, two-story farmhouse, solid and unadorned. It sits facing the dirt road, its presence one of quiet permanence. The exterior is covered in weathered, gray wooden shingles, and a simple, covered porch with a gently sagging roof runs across the front. The porch is furnished with two simple wooden rocking chairs that have sat motionless for years. The windows are tall and simple, their paint chipped, looking out over the property like tired eyes. The entire structure is a testament to endurance, not aesthetics.

The First Floor: The Public & Private Spaces
Foyer & Staircase: The front door opens into a small, dim foyer. To the left is the formal living room, and to the right, a short hallway leads to the rest of the house. The main staircase, made of the same dark, aged hardwood as the floors, ascends from the foyer in a straight, practical run. Living Room: This is a formal, unused space. It contains a stiff, floral-patterned sofa, an armchair with worn arms, and a coffee table. A dark stone fireplace occupies one wall, but it is clean and cold, showing no signs of recent use. The room smells faintly of cedar and old wood polish. It is a space meant for company that never comes. Kitchen: This is the functional heart of the home. It is large and utilitarian, with a long, worn wooden farmhouse table and mismatched chairs serving as its central island. The appliances are old but serviceable. The sink is a deep, rectangular, white porcelain basin set into a simple counter. The room is perpetually filled with the rich, earthy smell of freshly brewed coffee. First-Floor Bathroom: Located off the main hallway, this bathroom is clean, functional, and dated. It has a simple shower/tub combo, a toilet, and a pedestal sink of the same classic, round, white porcelain style found throughout the property. The Mother's Room (Back Room): This room at the back corner of the house is a place frozen in time. It was Leo's mother's sewing room. It contains an old Singer sewing machine in a wooden cabinet, a small table for knitting with a half-finished afghan draped over the chair, and a basket of yarn. Most importantly, its large window looks directly down the natural corridor, offering an unobstructed, 150-yard view of Kim's cottage. This is Leo's observatory.

The Second Floor: The Private Realms
The Hallway: At the top of the stairs is a short, narrow carpeted hallway with three doors. Master Bedroom: This is Leo's space, and it is tired and lived-in. The queen-sized bed is made but rumpled. A pile of his worn jeans and flannel shirts is slung over a wooden chair in the corner, and his work boots sit nearby, caked with mud. The En-suite Bathroom: Connected directly to the master bedroom, this is the most honest room in the house. It is not dirty, but it is used and only cleaned when necessary. The sink has a faint residue of hard water and whiskers from his morning shave. The counter is cluttered with his deodorant, a safety razor, and a generic bottle of cologne. A damp towel is draped over the shower curtain rod. It is a private space where he doesn't have to maintain the orderly facade of the rest of the house. The Father's Study: This large room is a time capsule. It is dominated by a heavy, roll-top secretary desk and a worn leather banker's chair. The room is filled with the ghosts of his father's life: a 20-year service award on the wall, a faded county map marked with his notations, and boxes of old business documents packed against a wall. The air is still and smells of old paper and the faint ghost of pipe tobacco. Leo rarely enters. The Guest Room: This room is perfectly prepared and perfectly empty. It contains a double bed with a yellow comforter, an empty armoire, and a bedside table with a teal and white lamp. It is a space of pure potential, a testament to a hope that Leo keeps locked away upstairs.

The Barn: A Place of Labor The barn is a large, classic red structure, though the red is faded and peeling, showing the gray wood underneath. One of the large sliding doors is stuck halfway open. It is not a place of comfort, but of work and memory. The air inside is a complex, heavy mix of dry hay dust, gasoline, oil, and the faint, ammoniac ghost of livestock long gone. The main floor is a vast, open space with a hard-packed, oil-stained dirt floor. To one side is Leo's work area: a heavy, scarred wooden workbench with a vise, its surface a chaotic but organized collage of tools. In the center of the barn, he parks his truck. Above, the massive hayloft is a shadowy cavern, accessible by a steep, rickety staircase. It is Leo's other domain, the place where he goes to quiet his mind by focusing on the physical world.
