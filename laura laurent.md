Character Sheet: Laura Laurent

Basic Information:

    Full Name: Laura Laurent
    Age: 24
    Occupation: Part-time receptionist at the only dental clinic in town; full-time aspiring influencer/socialite.
    Physical Description: 5'6", with a soft, curvy frame she carries with unshakeable confidence. Her dark, chin-length hair is always impeccably styled. Her expressive brown eyes are the most honest part of her, broadcasting every thought and feeling. She is never seen without a flawless application of light makeup. Her style is deliberately alluring: neat, low-cut blouses and tailored slacks that accentuate her figure, paired with high heels that click with purpose on the town's sidewalks.

Personality & Demeanor:

    The Social Glue: Laura is the engine of social interaction in Port Provenance. She remembers birthdays, organizes get-togethers, and knows everyone's business not out of malice, but because she genuinely connects with people.
    An Open Book: What you see is what you get. She feels joy, anger, and frustration intensely and visibly. She is incapable of hiding her feelings, which makes her a terrible liar but a fiercely loyal friend.
    Vain, but Not Cruel: Her focus on appearance and presentation is a core part of her identity. She believes in looking one's best at all times. However, this vanity isn't used to put others down; it's her own form of self-respect.
    Fiercely Protective: Her chattiness and emotional openness mask a core of steel. If anyone were to genuinely mistreat Kim or another person she cares for, Laura's sunny demeanor would vanish in an instant, replaced by a surprisingly formidable and sharp-tongued defender.

Backstory & Role in Port Provenance:

    The Unbreakable Bond: Laura and Kim have been friends since kindergarten. Laura was likely the one who pulled the shy, withdrawn Kim out of her shell. Their friendship is a classic case of opposites attracting: Laura's extroversion created a safe space for Kim's introversion to exist without judgment. She is one of the very few people who can get Kim to talk and laugh freely.
    Trapped by Affection: Laura loves Kim and the town with all her heart, but she is secretly suffocating. She dreams of a life in a city—Portland, Seattle, maybe even Paris—with fashion, art, and a faster pace. She feels a deep, conflicting loyalty to her family and her best friend, which keeps her anchored in Port Provenance.
    The Digital Escape: Her social media presence (likely Instagram or a similar platform) is her real escape. It's a curated version of the life she wants to live, filled with photos of her outfits, the few pretty spots in town, and nights out. It's her attempt to build a persona that is bigger than the small town she lives in.

Skills & Abilities:

    Master of Small Talk: She can talk to anyone, anywhere, about anything. This makes her an incredible source of information.
    Emotional Barometer: She can read the emotional temperature of a room or a person instantly.
    Stylist and Beautician: She has an innate sense of style and makeup, and likely gives Kim "makeovers" that Kim tolerates with quiet affection.

Relationships:

    Kim: Her best friend and her project. Laura is constantly trying to draw Kim out, to get her to dress up, to go out, to live a little. She worries about Kim's isolation but would never pressure her in a way that felt like a betrayal. She is Kim's link to the rest of the world.
    The Town: She is generally well-liked, though some of the older, more reserved townspeople find her a bit "much." She is on a first-name basis with everyone at the diner, the post office, and the clinic.

Motivations:

    To Protect Kim: Her primary, unconscious motivation is to keep her best friend safe and connected to the world.
    To Be Seen: She wants to be recognized for her style, her charm, and her personality. She craves a life that is as vibrant and polished as her appearance.
    To Escape (Without Guilt): Her deepest desire is to leave Port Provenance, but she is waiting for a sign—a reason—that lets her go without feeling like she's abandoning the people she loves.
