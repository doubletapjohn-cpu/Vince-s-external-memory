Name: Mike Dewalt

Physical Description: A man in his late 50s or 60s. He has a "weather beaten face" that looks "beaten," suggesting a life of hard work and recent, profound grief. He moves with the careful deliberation of a man who has had a bit too much to drink but is fully aware of his own limitations.

Personality & Psychology: Mike is a man hollowed out by loss. He is quiet, stoic, and communicates with a profound weariness. He is not unfriendly, but his emotions are buried deep under a surface of pragmatic resignation. He seems to have given up on social niceties, speaking only when necessary. The "faint tremor" in his voice when mentioning his son reveals the deep, unhealed wound at his core. He is a man simply going through the motions of life.

Backstory: Mike is a Navy veteran ("Don't call me sir, Left that crap behind with the Navy."). He owned the Airstream trailer, which was his son's home. His son recently died by drowning, a tragedy that has left Mike devastated and alone in his house, surrounded by his son's memory.

Relationship with Fayd: He is Fayd's new landlord. Their interaction is purely transactional, born of a recommendation from Gus. Mike sees Fayd as a source of income and perhaps a way to fill the empty space—both literally and emotionally—left by his son. He doesn't seem to have much interest in Fayd as a person, laying down a few simple ground rules with a detached, world-weary attitude.

Habits & Quirks: Sits on his front porch in the evenings, drinking Miller beer and smoking cigarettes. He is a man of simple, established routines.
