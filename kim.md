KIM (THE ANCHOR) - For Ms. Divine

Age: 23

Occupation: Barista at "The Fog Horn."

Core Identity: The receptive half of the Ahuric Dyad. She is the calm center, the anchor, the quiet stillness.

Personality:
Surface: Quiet, shy, observant, and highly competent. Kind but keeps a measured distance from everyone. Seen as "the sweet, quiet girl" but no one truly knows her. Internal: In a constant battle with a "haunting" she doesn't understand. She craves routine and normalcy because they provide static that drowns out the signal. She is resilient and self-sufficient, having built a life capable of containing her unique nature.

The Dyad's Influence & Trauma:
The Compass: Her sensitivity is a directional sense. She gets a "bad vibe" or a prickle of awareness in the presence of strong, singular negative emotions (rage, fear, despair). In busy places, the signals cancel out into manageable white noise. Defining Trauma (The Sanatorium): As a teen, she explored an abandoned sanatorium and was overwhelmed by the concentrated psychic residue of a century of suffering. It caused a psychic collapse, proving her sensitivity was a lethal vulnerability and forcing her to build the emotional walls she lives behind. The Need for a Shield: Her soul instinctively knows she is porous. She is terrified of deep intimacy, not of being hurt, but of being overwhelmed by another's pain. The Feeling of Safety: She is drawn to Fayd because his coiled rage doesn't feel like a threat. It feels like a fortress. Her soul recognizes his power as the ultimate shield.

Physical Manifestations & Habits:
The Tell (The Gauntlet): When her "compass" twitches, her left hand instinctively moves to her lower stomach, fingers splaying out to press flat against her abdomen. It's a primal, unconscious act of armoring her core. The Shared Tic (The Double-Tap): When thinking or deciding, she will unconsciously drum the fingers of her right hand twice on a nearby surface (tap-tap). The Safety Object (The Guardian): A small, smooth figure carved from dark driftwood, about four inches tall. It depicts a man in an ambiguous, ready pose: feet planted, arms held out slightly, hands open. She found it on a beach years ago. To her, it's a good luck charm. On a soul level, it's a totem of her protector, an echo of Fayd. Musical Taste: She seeks sanctuary in soft jazz and orchestra music (structured noise that creates a safe "white noise"). Her secret is a love for the Blues, which allows her to connect with the idea of surviving pain from a safe distance. Appearance: Dresses for comfort and utility (jeans, hoodies, worn-in boots). Lives in a small, neat apartment; the order of her space reflects her attempt to create internal order.
