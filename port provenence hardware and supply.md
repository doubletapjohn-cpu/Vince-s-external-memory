World-Building Brief: Port Provenance Supply & Hardware

Name: Port Provenance Supply & Hardware (referred to by locals as "Gus's")

Location & Purpose: Located on the main drag, right next to The Fog Horn. It is the town's practical hub, providing the tools, materials, and necessities for daily life and work. It represents the town's functional, hands-on, no-nonsense side.

Interior & Atmosphere:

    Layout: A long, wide space with high ceilings. The front section is dedicated to clothing and workwear—coats, boots, jeans, and new socks hanging on hooks. The back and side walls are lined with towering shelves stocked with hardware, tools, paint, and fishing supplies. A central aisle leads to the main counter at the back.
    Decor: The decor is purely functional. Big bay windows at the front display the merchandise. The floors are worn wood. The walls are a utilitarian, scuffed-up beige. The air smells of sawdust, new rubber, metal, and a faint, lingering scent of oil and fertilizer.
    Lighting: Harsh, practical fluorescent lighting from the ceiling strips illuminates every corner of the store, leaving no shadows.
    Key Features: An old, panned-glass door at the entrance. A central counter at the back, which is Gus's domain. A large, cork-backed bulletin board near the entrance, where locals still post "For Rent" signs, notices for lost dogs, and ads for odd jobs. It is a relic of an older way of communication.

Staff: The store is run by Gus, an older, weather-beaten man with a dry, cackling laugh and a wealth of local knowledge. He is a man of few words but is the unofficial information broker of the town. He is often seen behind the counter, looking bored but aware of everything.

Role in the Story: Gus's store serves as a critical point of information for newcomers. It is where Fayd is directed to find lodging, setting him on the path to Mike's Airstream and establishing his presence in the town. The bulletin board symbolizes the town's lingering, old-fashioned methods of connection, which Fayd must navigate to find his place.
