World-Building Brief: Port Provenance

    The Town: Layout and Vibe

Name: Port Provenance

Geographic Location: A small, isolated town on the coast, situated just a few miles off the main highway (presumably Highway 1). This slight detour makes it a place people end up in, rather than a destination they intentionally seek out. The town is bracketed on both ends by sheer, rocky cliffs, which creates a sense of containment and separateness from the rest of the world.

Economic Base: This is a working-class town, not a tourist trap. The primary industries are fishing and logging. This gives the town a practical, no-nonsense atmosphere. The salt air is present near the docks, with the specific odor of decaying fish, but this scent doesn't permeate the entire town.

Main Street: The central artery of Port Provenance is a narrow, two-lane road that is not wide enough for semi-trucks to pass easily. This reinforces the town's off-the-beaten-path feel. The buildings along this street are not decrepit, but they are weathered and show their age. They are well-maintained, giving the town a sense of quiet dignity. The architecture is characterized by older, darker brick buildings, often topped with worn wooden roofs that are old but not crumbling.

Overall Vibe: Port Provenance feels like a place that filters out casual visitors. It's a community for those who belong—fishermen, loggers, and people who are, for various reasons, content to live on the margins. It's a town that holds onto its people and its secrets. It is not sad or failing, but rather solid, self-contained, and dignified in its weathered existence.
