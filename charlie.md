Character Sheet: Charlie

Role: Short-order cook at Molly's Bar and unofficial bouncer.

Appearance:

    Late 40s to early 50s.
    Wears a permanently grease-stained apron over a t-shirt that struggles to contain his thick, beefy frame.
    Broad-shouldered and heavy-handed, built more like a longshoreman than a cook.
    His face is open and unlined, lacking the weary look of a man who's seen too much. He looks like a man who deals with problems directly and then forgets about them.

Personality:

    Simple & Direct: Charlie isn't one for subtext. He thinks in straight lines. If a problem is too complicated, he tends to lose interest.
    Loyal to Pam: He's not a thinker; he's a doer. When Pam needs muscle, Charlie provides it without question. It's a simple, functional relationship.
    Unobservant: He's focused on his grill and his instructions from Pam. The subtleties of conversation, the undercurrents of tension in the bar—they mostly fly right over his head. He's not being paid to be a spy, he's being paid to flip burgers and remove obstacles.
    Generally Good-Natured: He's not aggressive by nature, just... solid. He'll share a laugh with the regulars and doesn't hold grudges, mostly because he can't be bothered to.

History:

    A lifelong resident of Port Provenance.
    Has likely worked at Molly's for most of his adult life in some capacity. His value to the establishment has always been more about his physical presence than his culinary skill.
    Probably never had much ambition beyond his current, stable life. The bar is his world, and that suits him fine.

Relationships:

    Pam: His boss and primary instruction-giver. He understands her perfectly and acts as her enforcer when needed.
    Kim: He knows her as a town regular. He's friendly enough in a simple way, but her world of books and ideas is completely foreign to him.
    Feyd: He's barely registered him. Just another face in the crowd. Unless Pam tells him to pay attention to Feyd, he's just background noise.
