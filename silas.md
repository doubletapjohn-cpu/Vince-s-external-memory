Character Sheet: Silas

Basic Information:

    Full Name: Silas (last name unknown, or simply never used)
    Age: Late 50s to early 60s
    Occupation: Master Mechanic, Keeper of the Boatyard
    Physical Description: A big, older African American man who remains powerfully fit from a lifetime of physical labor. His hands are his most defining feature—large, calloused, and stained with a permanent map of grease and oil. His face is weathered by sun and sea, with sharp, intelligent eyes that seem to miss nothing. He moves with a deliberate, unhurried economy of motion.

Personality & Demeanor:

    The Quiet Observer: Silas is a man who listens more than he speaks. He gathers information through observation, letting others fill the silence. He doesn't engage in idle gossip but hears everything that happens on the docks.
    Pragmatic & No-Nonsense: He has no patience for drama, rumors, or posturing. His world is ruled by what works and what doesn't. He respects action over words and competence over confidence.
    A Fair Judge: He is the unofficial arbiter of character on the docks. He doesn't care about a man's past or his reputation; he cares about his skill and his willingness to work. His approval is not given easily, but once earned, it is absolute.
    Understated Humor: His humor is dry and delivered with a straight face, often catching people off guard. The grin that splits his face is a rare but genuine reward for earning his respect.

Backstory & Role in Port Provenance:

    The Anchor: Silas has been in Port Provenance for decades, likely arriving as a young man and never leaving. He is as much a part of the town as the docks themselves. He is the bedrock of the town's working community.
    Keeper of the Flame: He is the last of a dying breed of mechanics who can keep the old, temperamental diesel engines running through sheer skill and experience. Without him, half the town's fishing fleet would be rusting at the bottom of the bay.
    A Father Figure: To many of the younger fishermen, he is a mentor and a source of gruff wisdom. He is the person they turn to not just for engine trouble, but for life advice, though they'd have to be desperate to ask.
    The Gatekeeper: Unofficially, he decides who is and who isn't welcome to work on the docks. A man might get a job on a boat, but he doesn't truly have a place until Silas gives his nod of approval.

Skills & Abilities:

    Master Mechanic: He can diagnose an engine problem by the sound of its cough or the smell of its exhaust. His knowledge of marine diesels is encyclopedic.
    Expert Assessor of Character: His "test" with Feyd is second nature to him. He can size up a man's competence and honesty in a single interaction.
    Physically Capable: Despite his age, he possesses immense physical strength and stamina from years of hauling engines and wrestling with stubborn machinery.

Relationships:

    Feyd: He sees in Feyd a fellow professional—someone who understands the language of engines and the value of direct action. He respects Feyd's lack of excuses and his immediate, competent solution to the problem. He has given Feyd his stamp of approval, granting him a foothold in the town's working class.
    The Town: He is respected and, in some cases, feared by the other fishermen. They know his approval is their lifeline. He is a quiet pillar of the community, essential but rarely in the spotlight.

Motivations:

    To Keep the Fleet Running: His primary motivation is the simple, honest pride in his work and in keeping the town's heart beating.
    To Find Worthy Successors: He is implicitly looking for people who understand the old ways, who respect the work, and who can be trusted. His test of Feyd is as much about finding a reliable helper as it is about judging a newcomer.
