World-Building Brief: Port Provenance

The Bookstore

Location & Role: The bookstore is located on Port Provenance's main street, situated next to The Fog Horn coffee shop. It serves as the town's soul and sanctuary, the quiet counterpoint to the coffee shop's daily hum. If The Fog Horn is where the town conducts its daily business, the bookstore is where it houses its memories and dreams.

Atmosphere & Interior: It is a quiet, second-hand bookstore that feels like a refuge from the world. The air is filled not just with the scent of old paper, but also the faint, sweet smell of pipe tobacco and a hint of old leather from a few comfortable armchairs tucked in a corner. The lighting is dim and warm, coming from a few lamps, with light from the front window illuminating the swirls of dust motes in the air.

Function in the Narrative: This is the kind of place where Kim would feel at home. It is a space filled with other worlds, which is precisely what she needs when her own world has been shattered. It represents a quiet, intellectual comfort and an escape that is not about running, but about retreating into story.
