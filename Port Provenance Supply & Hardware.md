    Port Provenance Supply & Hardware - Final Revision

Location: Located on the main street, adjacent to The Fog Horn coffee shop. A shared rain gutter runs down the corner where the two buildings meet. It's not a small place; it's a long, deep building that holds a significant portion of the town's essential inventory.

Exterior: A red brick building. The front is defined by an old-style glass door with an aluminum frame, divided into upper and lower halves by a horizontal push bar. Two unbarred windows flank the door, offering a view into the front section.

Interior Layout & Atmosphere:
Entrance & "Supply" Section: The floor just inside the door is old, yellowed tile, worn unevenly from decades of foot traffic. The front section of the store, visible from the street, is the "Supply" part. Here, the shelves are stocked with essential dry goods—canned goods, bags of flour, sugar, coffee—as well as practical necessities like work boots, thick socks, and durable clothing. Refrigerated & Frozen Goods: Adjacent to the dry goods are the two major cold-storage units. They are old, commercial-grade units with heavy glass doors, constantly humming. The Refrigerator: The first unit holds the perishables: milk, butter, cheese, eggs, and sodas. The Freezer: The second unit is a freezer, stocked with frozen foods, including ice cream, steaks, and hamburger. Showroom & Hardware: The space opens up into a central area for larger items like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. Further back are the main aisles of tools, both manual and electric. The Counter: At the rear of the building is a very old, heavily scarred wooden counter. A blue cash register sits upon it. This is the nerve center of the store. Back Room: Behind the counter is a well-lit, larger storeroom stocked with piping, brackets, and a vast array of hardware sundries. Employee Entrance: Gus's private entrance is a solid, faded blue door with a black frame at the rear of the back room, topped with an old, internally-lit exit sign.

The Proprietor: The store is owned and operated by Gus, an old man who wears clothing that is decades out of style. He is the sole, silent authority of the establishment.

The Vibe: The store is the physical embodiment of the town's self-reliance. It is the one-stop-shop for life in Port Provenance, serving as the town's grocery, hardware store, and supply depot all in one. It is a place of quiet, unassuming competence. People arrive with a problem, whether it's a leaky faucet or an empty pantry, and they leave with the means to solve it. The constant hum of the old refrigerators is the store's heartbeat, a sound that signifies life and preservation. It is a place of function, not form, where a person's worth is measured by their practical needs and their ability to meet them. It is the town's shared toolbox, pantry, and a public utility, essential to its survival.
