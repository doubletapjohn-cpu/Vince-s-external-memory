Kim's Cottage: A Complete Description

The Cottage: Exterior The cottage is a small, single-story rectangle, located approximately 150 yards behind the main house, in a clearing at the end of a natural corridor. It is built of the same weathered, gray wood as the barn, but it is more humble and worn. A thick carpet of moss grows on the north-facing side of the roof. It looks less like a house and more like a part of the forest that has agreed to be a shelter. It has a small, rickety porch with no furniture, and three small windows covered on the inside by old, warped wooden shutters. The front door is a simple, unadorned slab of wood, painted a chipped, tired-looking gray. The air around it is still and smells of damp earth and cedar trees.

The Interior: A Fortress of Survival The moment you open the door, the smell hits you. It's a carefully constructed defense against the world: the sharp, artificial sweetness of scented candles or air fresheners fighting to cover the natural scent of old wood and the damp forest floor.
Main Room (Combined Kitchen and Living Space): The entire first floor is one open space, a deliberate mix of old and new that reflects Kim's attempt to build a life within the rustic shell. The kitchen area features an old, two-burner gas stove, but next to it is a newer, off-white refrigerator. The counter is slightly newer, a Formica in an off-white and speckled pattern, holding a simple white coffee maker. The living area is defined by the newer pieces she brought in: a small, deep sofa, a modern black C-table, and a bright red area rug that contrasts with the worn wood floors. Across from the sofa sits a flat-screen TV on a narrow table, and a small fireplace built from local, light-grey stone is set into the wall. The Bedroom: The bedroom door is directly across from the entry. Inside, the small room is dominated by her double bed, made up with white sheets and a thick, warm comforter in a red and blue checkerboard pattern. The headboard has two small lamps built into it and room for a few books. Against the wall stands a large, old, heavy, and solid wardrobe, an immovable object that feels like it could survive anything. The Bathroom: The entry to the small bathroom is a doorway with no door. It contains a standing shower with a curtain printed with a forest scene, a standalone sink, and a toilet. A small, more modern green table with a drawer is squeezed between the toilet and the sink, holding her bathroom essentials. A single, dark purple towel hangs on a small rack opposite the shower.

The cottage is a fortress. It's a place where new, clean, modern things are deliberately placed inside a worn, old shell. It's a space she has claimed and made her own, a small, bright bubble of modern life in the middle of the quiet, encroaching woods.
