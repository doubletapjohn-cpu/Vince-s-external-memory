Character Sheet: Leo Miller

Name: Leo Miller

Age: 42

Occupation: He does not have a formal job. He is the full-time caretaker and steward of the 80-acre family property, a role he inherited. He lives off a modest inheritance and what little he can earn from occasional handyman work for neighbors.

Physical Appearance: Leo is a man shaped by his environment and his labor. He is of average height and build, but with the lean, wiry strength of someone who works with his hands every day. His hair is a plain brown, usually unruly and in need of a cut. His face is lined not with age, but with a quiet, chronic weariness. His most defining feature is his eyes. They are a pale, washed-out blue, and they are almost always focused on something distant—either a task in front of him or the cottage in the woods. He has a habit of looking at the ground when spoken to, only making direct, fleeting eye contact when he is truly listening.

Personality & Psychology: Leo is a man of profound silence and deep, unspoken feeling. He is not shy, but reserved; he speaks only when he feels he has something of value to say, which is rarely. He is kind, but his kindness is practical and action-oriented—fixing a fence, leaving groceries on a porch—rather than verbal or emotional. He is bound by a powerful sense of duty, not just to his family's legacy, but to a personal, unarticulated code of care that extends to Kim. He is a creature of routine and solitude, finding more comfort in the company of the forest and the rhythm of his work than in conversation. His defining internal conflict is the war between his powerful, protective instincts and his absolute certainty that acting on them would cause more harm than good.

Backstory: Leo has lived on this property his entire life. He was raised by his parents, his father being a man of few words and hard labor, and his mother being the quiet, nurturing heart of the home. He was never taught how to process or express emotion, only how to work and to provide. His father passed away a decade ago, followed by his mother a few years later. His father was forced to sell off a large portion of the original 80-acre property to Kim's family during a period of financial hardship, a transaction that was likely less about business and more about a promise to look after them. Leo inherited the remaining land and the role of caretaker for both the property and, by extension, Kim.

Relationship with Kim: Leo's feelings for Kim are the central, unspoken truth of his life. He is deeply, silently in love with her, a love that manifests as a fierce, protective guardianship. He watches over her from a distance, ensuring her driveway is clear, that her car starts in the winter, that she is safe. He has never acted on these feelings, believing that his world is too quiet and broken to be a part of hers. He sees her as something good and bright that he would only tarnish. His love is a burden he carries alone, expressed in quiet deeds and constant vigilance from his mother's sewing room window.

Habits & Quirks: He starts every day with coffee made in the same pot. He talks to his dog, or to himself, more than he talks to other people. He can fix almost anything mechanical. He finds peace in the repetitive, physical tasks of property maintenance. He never, ever enters his father's study. He sleeps on his side of the bed, leaving the other side untouched. He watches the evening news not for the news, but for the sound of another human voice in his quiet house.
