Character Sheet: Kim

Name: Kim

Age: 29

Occupation: Barista at The Fog Horn. She is skilled at her job and finds a small measure of peace in the rhythmic, predictable motions of making coffee. It's a job that allows her to interact with the town on her own controlled terms.

Physical Appearance: Kim has a fragile, ethereal quality that belies a deep inner strength. She is slender, with fine, delicate features. Her most defining characteristic is her large, expressive green eyes, which seem to perceive a world others cannot. Her hair is a soft, unruly brown, often tied back in a loose ponytail. She favors comfortable, practical clothing—faded jeans, soft hoodies, worn-out boots—that allows her to blend in and feel protected.

Personality & Psychology: Kim is highly introverted and lives a life of carefully constructed solitude. She is quiet and observant, possessing a deep well of empathy that is often overwhelming. Her psychic sensitivity is not a superpower; it is a debilitating condition she calls "The Gauntlet," a painful, physical sensation of absorbing the ambient emotions of those around her. She is constantly defending herself against this psychic noise, which has led to severe anxiety and a fear of crowded spaces and emotional intensity. She is intelligent and self-aware, but trapped by her own condition.

Backstory: Kim was not born in Port Provenance but arrived a few years ago, seeking a quiet place to escape the overwhelming psychic noise of a larger city. She was drawn to the town's subdued atmosphere. She found the Miller Property and Leo, a quiet, grieving man who asked no questions and offered her a place to live in exchange for help around the property. This arrangement is perfect for her, providing sanctuary and a gentle, non-intrusive guardian figure. She has no known family and lives in a state of self-imposed isolation, finding solace in her small cottage, her semi-feral cat Hector, and the quiet rhythm of her job.

Relationship with Fayd: Her connection to Fayd is the single most terrifying and profound event of her life. He is the only person whose presence doesn't trigger The Gauntlet. Instead, he creates a "stillness" or a "quiet hum" that is a profound relief. However, this connection is also a source of immense fear and confusion. She is drawn to him with an undeniable magnetic pull, but she is terrified of the intensity of the bond and what it might mean. He is the only person who has ever truly "seen" her, and that level of vulnerability is terrifying.

Habits & Quirks: She is a creature of routine and ritual. She finds comfort in the physical world—the smell of coffee, the feel of driftwood, the warmth of her cat. She is prone to panic attacks and will often physically retreat (fleeing a room, a building, a conversation) when overwhelmed. She has a habit of tracing patterns on surfaces—countertops, tables, her own leg—as a self-soothing mechanism. Her most prized possession is the Guardian, a piece of driftwood she carved that perfectly mirrors Fayd's protective stance, a fact she is only just beginning to comprehend.
