Defining Trauma (The Sanatorium).

Here are the details as we defined them:

As a teenager, Kim explored an abandoned sanatorium. While inside, she was overwhelmed by the concentrated psychic residue of a century of suffering and agony left behind in the building. This event caused a psychic collapse, proving to her that her sensitivity was a lethal vulnerability.

This trauma is the reason she built the emotional walls she now lives behind. It's the source of her deep-seated fear of being overwhelmed by another's pain and her reliance on routine and "white noise" as a defense mechanism.
