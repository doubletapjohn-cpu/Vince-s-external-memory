Character Sheet: Hector (Updated)

Name: Hector

Species: Domestic Tabby (Felis catus)

Appearance: Hector is a large, muscular tomcat, built more like a pitbull than a typical house cat. He is a classic brown tabby, with bold, dark swirling stripes over a lighter, tan-and-gray coat. His fur is thick, coarse, and often looks a bit unkempt, as if he's just been in a fight. The most telling features are his ears: the top of his left ear is cleanly notched, and the right ear has a small, ragged V-shaped tear at the tip—trophies from countless territorial disputes. His eyes are a sharp, intelligent amber, and they are always scanning, always watchful. He moves with a liquid, predatory grace, even when he's just walking across Kim's small porch.

Personality & Psychology: Hector is a survivor. He is semi-feral, a creature governed by a cautious calculus of risk and reward. He is fiercely independent and deeply territorial, viewing the woods around the cottage as his kingdom. He is not aggressive without cause, but he will not tolerate a perceived threat. His trust is not given; it is earned, and even then, it is conditional. He is a creature of habit and shadows, appearing and disappearing on his own mysterious schedule. His affection for Kim is real, but it is expressed in brief, intense bursts before his wild nature compels him to return to the hunt. He possesses an uncanny ability to read the true nature of others, responding not to words or actions, but to the primal energy they project.

Backstory: Hector was likely born in a feral litter somewhere deep in the state forest. He spent his first year or two fighting for every meal and every inch of territory. He learned that humans were a source of both danger and potential food. At some point, his wanderings brought him to the edge of Kim's clearing. Unlike others who might have shooed him away, she simply watched him and began leaving out food. It was this quiet respect that slowly won him over. He now sees her as a fixed point in his territory, a reliable source of comfort and sustenance, but not his owner.

Relationship with Kim: Hector's relationship with Kim is the only truly gentle one in his life. She is his safe harbor. He will jump onto her small sofa and allow her to scratch the spot just above his tail, purring a deep, rumbling engine that seems too loud for his tough exterior. He is the only living thing she touches with regular, gentle affection. In return, he provides her with silent, uncomplicated companionship. He doesn't ask questions. He doesn't make demands. He is simply there, a warm, purring presence that reminds her she is capable of being a source of comfort.

Relationship with Fayd: Hector's relationship with Fayd is one of immediate and mutual recognition. There is no period of caution or testing. From their first meeting, Hector sees in Fayd the same kind of dominant, primal fighter he is—a fellow apex predator who understands the unspoken language of the wild. He does not see Fayd as a threat or a master, but as an equal. In turn, Fayd does not try to tame or coddle Hector; he admires the cat's untamed spirit and his ability to simply be an animal, living by his own code. Their bond is a silent, instinctual alliance of two respected survivors.

Habits & Quirks: He will only eat food that Kim leaves out. He sleeps in her cottage only on the coldest, harshest winter nights, and is always gone by first light. He patrols his territory along a set route at dawn and dusk. He communicates with a series of low, guttural chirps and meows that he only uses with Kim. He has a specific spot on the red rug where he likes to lie in the rare patch of afternoon sun. He is completely aware of Leo, viewing him as a distant, non-threatening part of the landscape, like a particular tree or a large rock. When Fayd arrives, Hector's behavior shifts subtly; he will often be found near him, a silent, watchful shadow, acknowledging him as a co-regent of his domain.
