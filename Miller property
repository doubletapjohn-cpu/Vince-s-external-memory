World-Building Brief: The Miller Property

Name: The Miller Property

Location & Purpose: A large, secluded parcel of land on the outskirts of Port Provenance. It serves as a liminal space between the order of the town and the untamed wilderness of the surrounding forest. It is a place of quiet history, solitude, and unspoken guardianship.

Layout & Structures:

    Main House: A two-story, saltbox-style house, faded white with dark green trim. It sits at the front of the property, overlooking the dirt road. It is the home of Leo Miller. The house is well-maintained but shows the quiet wear of a life lived without much fuss. The back porch offers a clear, unobstructed view down a natural corridor to the cottage.
    The Barn: A large, classic red barn, its paint weathered and peeling. It sits a short distance from the main house. It is a place of work and practicality, filled with the scent of old wood, hay, and tools. It is Leo's domain.
    The Cottage: Kim's home. A small, one-room cottage with a moss-covered roof, nestled in a clearing at the back of the property, partially obscured by trees. It is her self-made sanctuary, a place of retreat and control.
    Grounds: The property is defined by a crumbling, low stone wall. The space between the main house and the cottage is an open field, overgrown in some places, with a well-worn dirt path connecting the structures.

Atmosphere: The property is defined by a profound, heavy silence. It is a place where history hangs in the air. The atmosphere is one of respectful solitude and constant, unspoken vigilance. It feels safe, but also watched.

Role in the Story: The Miller Property is Kim's sanctuary and the symbolic heart of her isolation. It is also the domain of Leo Miller, her silent, grieving guardian. The property itself acts as an ecosystem reflecting the psychological states of its inhabitants, with Leo's watchful presence from the main house mirroring Fayd's protective instincts over Kim. The cottage is where the central mystery of the Guardian carving is housed, and where its true nature is eventually revealed.
