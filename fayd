Fayd - Character Sheet

Physical Description: Fayd is a man of stark, monolithic presence, standing an even six feet tall. His build is that of a high-performance endurance athlete—lean, corded with the dense, functional strength of a rock climber, not the bulky power of a weightlifter. His face is rugged and iconic, similar to a young Sam Elliott without the mustache, with a strong jaw and deep-set features that speak of a quiet history. His hair is the color of dark iron-grey, severe and stark. His most defining feature is his piercing grey eyes, the true barometer of his state. Most of the time, they hold a quiet, caring warmth, but when his Animal side emerges, they become terrifyingly cold and implacable, the flat, emotionless grey of a blade moments before the strike. He favors practical, durable clothing in muted colors.

Personality & Psychology: Fayd is a man defined by his internal war. He is fundamentally gentle, thoughtful, and poetic, with a deep well of empathy. This is the man he wants to be. However, he lives in constant fear of a darker, primal part of himself he calls "the Animal." This "Animal" is the raw, untamed core of his nature, a manifestation of pure, instinctual aggression and protectiveness. In his past, it led to fights, jail time, and deep-seated shame. To cope, he has built a "cage" in his mind, a mental prison where he locks the Animal away. This act of self-imprisonment is a source of constant, low-level anxiety. He is riddled with guilt over a past incident where the Animal lashed out and caused someone he loved significant harm. This trauma is the bedrock of his current self-control.

Abilities & Skills:

    The Animal: While he keeps it caged, the Animal is a source of immense physical power and primal instinct. If he chooses to "open the cage," he becomes a terrifyingly effective fighter, driven by pure, protective rage. He does not enjoy this; it is a last resort that always leaves him feeling hollow and ashamed.
    Observation: Years of watching himself have made him incredibly skilled at watching others. He reads body language and micro-expressions with an almost paranoid level of detail.
    Practical Skills: He is self-sufficient and capable with his hands, likely skilled in things like woodworking, mechanics, or other trades that require focus and physical control.
    Poetry/Writing: This is his outlet. It is the only way he can safely process the darkness inside him, turning his fear and aggression into words on a page.

Core Motivation: His entire life is an act of atonement. He is not seeking forgiveness from others, but from himself. His primary motivation is to keep the Animal caged, to never again let it hurt someone he loves. He seeks a quiet, controlled life where he can cause no harm. He is drawn to Kim because she was the only person who could look at the Animal and not see a monster. She was his only chance at salvation, a concept that both terrifies and intrigues him.
