World-Building Brief: The Fog Horn

Name: The Fog Horn

Location & Purpose: The primary coffee shop and social hub of Port Provenance. It's located on the main drag, serving as the town's functional heart. It's where people start their day, catch up on local gossip, and feel the comforting rhythm of community. It represents the town's conscious, public-facing identity.

Interior & Atmosphere:

    Layout: A long, narrow space with a polished wooden counter running most of its length. A few small, mismatched wooden tables and chairs are arranged along one wall, and a worn, cushioned booth sits in the back corner.
    Decor: The walls are painted a warm, inviting cream. Shelves behind the counter hold bags of locally roasted coffee beans, mismatched mugs, and various syrups. A large chalkboard lists the daily specials and drinks in neat, artistic handwriting. The air is thick with the rich, grounding scent of coffee and the faint sweetness of pastries.
    Lighting: Soft, warm lighting from old-fashioned filament bulbs creates a cozy, intimate atmosphere, especially in the mornings and evenings.
    Key Features: A vintage espresso machine that hisses and steams with practiced efficiency. A small bell above the door that jingles cheerfully with every entry and exit, serving as the constant, rhythmic pulse of the shop.

Staff: The shop is staffed by a small crew of locals, including Kim. The atmosphere is one of quiet, professional competence. The manager, Sarah, is a no-nonsense but kind woman in her late thirties who is attuned to her staff's well-being.

Role in the Story: The Fog Horn is the site of the first significant interaction between Kim and Fayd after the initial dog encounter. It's the place where their unspoken connection is first tested and made tangible through the sketch. It also represents the "safe" but ultimately stifling nature of the town's community, whose protectiveness becomes a source of conflict.
