FAYD (THE WANDERER) -

Age: 31

Occupation: Poet (published under a pseudonym) and manual laborer (odd jobs).

Physical desription: Fayd is a man of stark, monolithic presence, standing an even six feet tall. His build is that of a high-performance endurance athlete—lean, corded with the dense, functional strength of a rock climber, not the bulky power of a weightlifter. His face is rugged and iconic, similar to a young Sam Elliott without the mustache, with a strong jaw and deep-set features that speak of a quiet history. His hair is the color of dark iron-grey, severe and stark. His most defining feature is his piercing grey eyes, the true barometer of his state. Most of the time, they hold a quiet, caring warmth, but when his Animal side emerges, they become terrifyingly cold and implacable, the flat, emotionless grey of a blade moments before the strike. He favors practical, durable clothing in muted colors.

Core Identity: The aggressive half of the Ahuric Dyad. He is the storm, the shield, the animalistic force.

Personality:
Surface: Quiet, self-contained, intensely observant. A man of few words, which some mistake for shyness. It is discipline. He can appear unnervingly still. He is polite but distant, moving through town like a ghost. Internal: In a constant, exhausting battle with the "Animal" inside him—a primal, territorial, and violently protective rage that he has learned to cage. He is haunted by the knowledge of what he's capable of and lives by a strict code to keep the monster locked away.

The Dyad's Influence & Trauma:
The Cage: He has constructed a mental prison for the Animal. Its power "bleeds" through in moments of intensity—a predatory stillness, a low-frequency growl, an unsettling gaze. Defining Trauma (The Jail Time): In his late teens/early twenties, his explosive rage led to a serious assault that landed him in jail. He was shot in the altercation. The experience was a brutal confirmation of his monstrous nature and motivated him to build the cage with ruthless discipline. The Unknowing Protector: The Animal's primary drive is protection. Before meeting Kim, this was a vague, unfocused energy. After meeting her, its protective instincts become singularly and terrifyingly focused on her as its other half. The Poet's Resonance: When he sees something that trips his nature, his brain translates the feeling into allegorical verse. It's an involuntary, emotional synesthesia. (e.g., Seeing Kim's eyes: "I sailed a sea of green, the rough waves, battering my tiny ship, I looked into the depths, and longed to drown myself there.")

Physical Manifestations & Habits:
The Scar: A puckered, circular gunshot scar on the upper left side of his torso, just above his heart. A constant physical reminder of the night his rage went too far. The Tell (The Pocketed Hands): His default, at-ease posture is with his hands tucked into his front pockets. It's a physical act of containing the Animal, keeping his weapons out of sight and mind. When his control is tested, his hands will clench into fists inside his pockets. The Shared Tic (The Double-Tap): When thinking or deciding, he will unconsciously drum the fingers of his right hand twice on a nearby surface (tap-tap). The Confrontation Stance: When forced to let the Animal's presence bleed out (as with the dogs), he unconsciously adopts the exact pose of Kim's carving: feet planted, arms held out slightly, hands open. Appearance: Wears practical, durable clothing (work boots, canvas jackets, denim). Has a lean, wiry strength from manual labor. Carries a worn notebook and pen at all times. Never stays in one place for too long.
