Character Sheet: Fayd

Name: Fayd

Age: 38

Occupation: Wanderer. He survives on a combination of seasonal manual labor (fishing canneries, construction, landscaping) and the odd, under-the-table handyman job. He has no fixed address and owns little more than what he can carry in his worn canvas backpack.

Physical Appearance: Fayd is a man shaped by a life lived outdoors. He is tall and lean, with a wiry, sinewy strength that is deceptive in its economy of motion. His hair is an iron-grey, cut short and practical. His face is weathered, tanned, and lined, but not with age; with sun, wind, and a profound, quiet weariness. His most defining feature is his eyes. They are a pale, penetrating grey, and they seem to see far more than he ever speaks. He moves with a fluid, predatory grace that is both unnerving and captivating.

Personality & Psychology: Fayd is a man of profound silence and deep, unspoken feeling. He is not shy, but reserved; he speaks only when he feels he has something of value to say, which is rarely. He is a creature of instinct and observation, preferring to watch and listen rather than engage. He is bound by a powerful, personal code of ethics that is almost primal in its simplicity: he does not tolerate bullies, and he protects those who cannot protect themselves. His defining internal conflict is his constant battle to control the Animal. The Animal is a feral, instinct-driven force of pure rage and protective aggression that lives inside him. It is the source of his strength and his greatest curse. He has spent his life building a cage for it, but the bars are constantly tested.

Backstory: Fayd has no memory of his parents or a life before the age of ten, when he escaped a brutally abusive foster home. He survived on his own in the wilderness as a feral child, the Animal his only true companion. As a teenager, he was discovered and taken in by an old, solitary trapper who taught him how to read, how to work with his hands, and, most importantly, how to build the cage. The trapper's death a few years later left him alone again, but this time with the tools to survive in the civilized world. He has been wandering ever since, never staying in one place for too long, fearing the Animal might break free and hurt someone.

Relationship with Kim: His feelings for Kim are a terrifying, confusing, and overwhelming force that he has never experienced before. The Animal, which usually reacts to threats with aggression, becomes calm, alert, and fiercely protective in her presence. It sees her not as a threat or a weakness, but as its mate. This terrifies Fayd. He is drawn to her with a magnetic intensity that defies all his logic and self-preservation instincts. He feels a primal need to be near her, to protect her, but he is also terrified that his own monstrous nature will ultimately destroy her.

Habits & Quirks: He talks to himself more than he talks to other people, often holding silent, internal debates with the Animal. He can fix almost anything mechanical. He finds peace in the repetitive, physical tasks of manual labor. He never sleeps with his back to an open door. He is acutely aware of every entrance and exit in any room he enters. He eats simply and voraciously, like a wild animal that is never sure when its next meal will be. He is drawn to classical music and orchestra, finding the complex, structured noise to be the only thing that can quiet the constant, low-level hum of the Animal in his head.
